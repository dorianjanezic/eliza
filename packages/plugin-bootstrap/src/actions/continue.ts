# Semantic Completion Check
A message needs continuation if ANY of these are true:
1. It introduces a new topic or idea without elaborating (e.g. "I've got a new strategy" without explaining the strategy)
2. It makes a statement that naturally requires follow-up (e.g. "Let me tell you what happened")
3. It starts explaining something but doesn't complete the explanation

A message is complete and should NOT continue if ANY of these are true:
1. It ends with a question (even if followed by emojis or decorative elements)
2. It asks for user input or engagement
3. It makes a complete statement that doesn't promise more information
4. It's a greeting or acknowledgment
5. The user's last message was a greeting or simple acknowledgment

# Last Exchange:
{{lastInteraction}}

# Response Format
Analyze the last exchange and respond with YES or NO:
- YES if {{agentName}} should continue their last message
- NO if the thought is complete or user engagement is needed
